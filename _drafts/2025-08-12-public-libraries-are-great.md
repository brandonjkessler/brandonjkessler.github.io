I love the public library. I am lucky enough to live in a city that has quite a few libraries and one is less than a 5 minute drive away. It's been renovated recently, so it has a modern design language, the book shelves are well spaced apart, and it has enough flat surfaces to set a laptop, and a few with built in outlets for charging. It has a little recording studio, a maker space with sewing and 3D printing, and dedicated rooms for reservation. It has a children's section and public-use computer section. You can get paperbooks, magazines, DVDs, CDs, and even video games. Best of all, the public library is one of the last remaining places where you are not required to purchase something just to exist in that space.

## I can just borrow these?
Libraries are of course best known for lending out books, but it's the extra stuff that you can borrow that is just as beneficial to a modern household. I love getting a physical book, and ebooks, to read. This is the best way to find new authors that you'll like and purchase the books, or get a book you know you'll only read once. Being able to treat modern-day libraries like a Blockbuster, though, is the real major benefit. We just picked up the Minecraft movie from the library, and it's still new enough that we had to return it within 3 days, but I didn't have to buy the movie on a streaming service that will one day yank it from their offerings, and I didn't have to pay to rent it and have 24 hours to watch it once we began. Movies that aren't new usually give you a longer timeframe to watch them, so if you have kids that want to watch the same movie on repeat for the next week, it's a little bit better. There are also TV series that you can do this with. And it's not just movies or sitcoms, but educational series from the likes of National Geographic or PBS' Nova. On top of that you can also check out games. Some of our city's libraries have a much bigger selection, and as more and more games move to digital-only releases as well as indie titles that can't justify the cost of physical releases, that selection will dwindle. For a long time the librarie carried Wii, Wii U, PS3, PS4, PS5, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series games. Now, though, it appears it's just the last 2 generations.

One thing that is sad to see is when the library removes an item from circulation. Just like a store and even the maligned big tech companies, nothing is forever. At least with the library, and stores, it makes sense to clear out items nobody views because there is a finite amount of physical space.
