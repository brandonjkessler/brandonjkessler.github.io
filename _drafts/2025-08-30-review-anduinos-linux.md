Recently my used MacPro 2013 (TrashMacPro) died on me. It refuses to load MacOS and I've tried multiple SSDs, different known good RAM sticks, etc. Looks like it's toast. I absolutely refuse to go back to Windows as a consumer, and I can't really justify buying another computer at the moment, so I went in search of a linux operating system that I can throw on a spare laptop to use as my daily driver. I started on SUSE back in the day, and then moved to Ubuntu 8.10 I think. From there I've distro-hopped between SUSE and some form of Debian derivatives. I tried Kubuntu but HATE Snaps. They aren't compelling enough to switch to and aren't actual as portable as Flatpaks because of some [security settings that are currently Ubuntu only](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/is-it-less-secure-to-run-snaps-in-opensuse/44601/3). This led me to [AnduinOS](https://www.anduinos.com), an Ubuntu derivative that looks and feels similar to Windows 11.

## What is AnduinOS
AnduinOS is the brainchild of Anduin Xue, an ex-Microsoft Software Engineer, that they developed in their spare time. In their post "[Story behind AnduinOS - A letter from Anduin](https://news.anduinos.com/post/2025/5/6/story-behind-anduinos-a-letter-from-anduin)" they write "It was simply a toy and practice exercise I put together during a leisurely afternoon." They mention the use of Windows at work, and they prefer the interaction logic of Windows, but not the actual shell and adds. In their spare time they use Linux exclusively, preferring Arch or NixOS. The gist of the letter is that they created AnduinOS as a passion project in such a way that requires very little maintenance. It also appears to be more of a showcase for the build system they hope that AnduinOS will be "...user-friendly experience for decades but also to become a versatile customization tool and builder for Linux distributions," according to their post in [AnduinOS Future Development and Roadmap](https://news.anduinos.com/post/2025/5/21/anduinos-future-development-and-roadmap)

## Installing
This is a pretty short section since if you've ever installed Ubuntu nothing here will seem drastically different. You'll walk through the basic system setup, and it has a few nice customizations, but it's nothing crazy, which to be frank, is nice. A simple and intuitive installer built on something that Ubuntu has refined is not a terrible idea. And it also symbolizes what AnduinOS is going to be overall. It's Ubuntu, but tweaked in some interesting ways.
