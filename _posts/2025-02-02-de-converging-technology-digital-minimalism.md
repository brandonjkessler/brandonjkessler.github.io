<h2>What is De-converging</h2>
De-converging, or de-convergence, is the opposite of converging or convergence. It's a made-up word. The gist, the feeling, is that it's breaking apart these bits of technology that we've melded together for convenience. Western society, and much of the world from what I gather, is constantly aiming to make the technology we use more convenient and do more and more functions, i.e. the smart phone. There are many benefits to this convenience and convergence, but there are also many unforeseen consequences. I am personally discovering unhealthy habits and problems from technology and these <em>de-converging</em> posts will be a my exploration of having healthier habits.
