Today is Black Friday, and we all know that means there are Deals to be had!

GameStop isn’t usually the most economical choice for picking up systems and video games, but they are brick-and-mortar, which is nice when things go wrong. Today I was looking through their deals and noticed that there’s a few Wii U bundles out there, starting at $89!

There are bundles with a bunch of the [Mario Party Games](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/more-platforms/wii-u/consoles/products/wii-u-competitive-mario-blast-from-the-past-system-bundle/B123658G.html), and another one with most of the [Mario platformers](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/more-platforms/wii-u/consoles/products/wii-u-super-mario-collection-blast-from-the-past-system-bundle/B123658F.html), and another with the [Legend of Zelda bundle](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/more-platforms/wii-u/consoles/products/wii-u-zelda-collection-blast-from-the-past-system-bundle/B123658H.html). If you read my [previous post about the]({% post_url 2019-11-04-is-the-wii-u-worth-it-in-2019 %}) Wii U, I stated that the console was worth it for the reduced cost of excellent games and virtual console. These bundles make that even more enticing. There were some bundles that jumped the price up to $150 and up, but with all the games for the Wii U being so inexpensive used, it’s still a good deal.

I just bought the “Competitive Mario” bundle that includes Mario Kart 8, Mario Party 10, and Mario Tennis for my daughter’s room. We can retire her Wii, but all the games she’s been playing and enjoying will continue to work. We already have a growing collection of games, so I think she’ll get even more use out of it.
