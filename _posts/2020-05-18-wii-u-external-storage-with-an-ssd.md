Recently my Wii U has been running out of space. A couple of modern games and the paltry 32GB of storage is filled. The Wii U does allow you add more storage via USB, and I had a 32GB Flash Drive dedicated to that task, however that was also running out of room. Being a tech nerd I had a few random 2.5″ external HDDs lying around, but the Wii U was unable to supply enough power over one USB to get the drives to work. The Wii U only has USB 2.0, so it’s less power than a 3.0 port.

Luckily, I have a spare 128GB SSD lying around, too, and after swapping the case off of another external HDD, I created a 128GB external SSD. It’s fast, silent, and best of all it works. If you were to buy the parts new, the [External Enclosure](https://www.newegg.com/orico-2189u3-bk-enclosure/p/0VN-0003-000Z3?Description=HDD%20external%20enclosure&cm_re=HDD_external_enclosure-_-9SIA1DS4VX9066-_-Product) would set you back between $6 and $10, and a [120GB SSD](https://www.newegg.com/patriot-burst-120gb/p/N82E16820225081?Item=N82E16820225081&cm_sp=Homepage_SS-_-P3_20-225-081-_-05112020&quicklink=true) is about $24 as of this writing. That being said, you can get 120/128GB Flash drives for as little as $20, so it’s a $14 difference. If I didn’t already have parts and pieces lying around I’d probably have just bought a flash drive. The speed gains of the SSD over the flash drive are probably non-existent since the Wii U is only running USB 2.0. The only upside to an SSD is probably far more write operations vs a flash drive.
