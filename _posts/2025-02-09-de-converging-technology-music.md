<h2>What is De-converging</h2>
For the full introduction, check out the previous post De-converging Technology - Introduction. 

De-converging, or de-convergence, is the opposite of converging or convergence. It's a made-up word. The gist, the feeling, is that it's breaking apart these bits of technology that we've melded together for convenience. Western society, and much of the world from what I gather, is constantly aiming to make the technology we use more convenient and do more and more functions, i.e. the smart phone. There are many benefits to this convenience and convergence, but there are also many unforeseen consequences.
